Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562 foreign key business_id
iii. Category = 2643 foreign key business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 foreign key business_id
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493 foreign key business_id
vii. Photo = 1000
viii. Tip = 3979 foreign key business_id
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11 foreign key user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 foreign key user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

id                     | name     | review_count | yelping_since       | useful |  funny |   cool | fans | average_stars | compliment_hot | compliment_more | compliment_profile | compliment_cute | compliment_list | compliment_note | compliment_plain | compliment_cool | compliment_funny | compliment_writer compliment_photos

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT COUNT(*) --count all columns
	FROM user -- select the table
	WHERE id IS NULL -- the condition to count it is only if any value of the next columns is null
	OR name IS NULL
	OR review_count IS NULL
	OR yelping_since IS NULL
	OR useful IS NULL
	OR funny IS NULL
	OR cool IS NULL 
	OR fans IS NULL 
	OR average_stars IS NULL 
	OR compliment_hot IS NULL 
	OR compliment_more IS NULL 
	OR compliment_profile IS NULL
	OR compliment_cute IS NULL
	OR compliment_list IS NULL
	OR compliment_note IS NULL
	OR compliment_plain IS NULL
	OR compliment_cool IS NULL
	OR compliment_funny IS NULL
	OR compliment_writer IS NULL
	OR compliment_photos IS NULL
	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 3		avg:3.7082 
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0 		max: 5.0 		avg: 3.6549 
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT city, -- select the column
SUM(review_count) AS total_reviews -- calculate the total of reviews and save it in the column total_reviews
FROM business -- select the table from which you will take the columns
GROUP BY city  -- group by the city column
ORDER BY total_reviews DESC -- to give the order of appearance
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT id, -- select the columns
name,
review_count,

+------------------------+--------+--------------+------+	


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	No, by pulling the table above in descending order for fans, we can see that the user with more reviews is on fourth position and the first three positions and the ones below,
	have less than half the revies or aproximetly half the reviews.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: More reviews with word "hate"
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(text) AS TOTAL --count from column text and writing the name total
FROM review -- selecting the table
WHERE text LIKE '%love%' OR 'love%' OR '%love' OR '%LOVE%' OR 'LOVE%'OR '%LOVE' -- condition to count the word love in different writing types
UNION -- unifying the two count for the two words to see the result in one table
SELECT COUNT(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE '%hate%' OR 'hate%' OR '%hate' OR '%HATE%' OR 'HATE%'OR '%HATE'
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT name, -- selecte the columns
	fans
	FROM user -- select the table from which you will take the columns
	ORDER BY fans DESC -- order the results by a descending amount of fans
	LIMIT 10; -- quantity of results displayed
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
